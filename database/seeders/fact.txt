//  30 Amazing Dinosaur Facts For Kids

<li><strong>Dinosaurs ruled the Earth during the Mesozoic Era </strong>an epoch of monumental geological and biological significance that stretched from approximately 252 to 66 million years ago. This era, often referred to as the “Age of Dinosaurs,” witnessed the emergence, dominance, and eventual extinction of these magnificent creatures. From the colossal sauropods to the agile theropods, the Mesozoic Era was a time of unparalleled diversity and evolution, shaping the landscapes and ecosystems of our planet in profound ways.</li>
<li><strong>The term “dinosaur” has its roots in the Greek language, with “dino” meaning “terrible” and “saur” meaning “lizard.” </strong>Coined in the 19th century by British scientist Sir Richard Owen, the name aptly captures the awe-inspiring and sometimes fearsome nature of these ancient reptiles. Despite their intimidating moniker, dinosaurs encompassed a wide range of species with varying sizes, shapes, and behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Dinosaurs were a globally distributed group of animals, and they inhabited every continent on Earth, including Antarctica. </strong>During the Mesozoic Era, when dinosaurs flourished, Antarctica was located much closer to the equator and had a milder climate. Fossil discoveries in Antarctica have revealed evidence of diverse dinosaur species adapted to this ancient environment.</li>
<li><strong>The Argentinosaurus is indeed one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered</strong>renowned for its colossal size and immense weight. Fossil evidence suggests that this gigantic herbivore could reach lengths of up to 100 feet and weigh as much as 100 tons, making it one of the most massive land animals to have ever existed. the group of long-necked sauropod dinosaurs, the Argentinosaurus roamed the Earth during the Late Cretaceous period.</li>
<li><strong>Despite the popular image of dinosaurs as towering giants, many species were surprisingly small</strong>some even comparable in size to modern-day birds. The Microraptor is a perfect example of these diminutive dinosaurs. Measuring only about two feet (0.6 meters) in length and weighing around 2 pounds (1 kilogram), Microraptor was indeed similar in size to a chicken.</li>
<li><strong>One of the most fascinating aspects of dinosaurs is their incredible diversity in shapes and sizes.</strong>From the towering giants to the low-slung armored tanks, dinosaurs exhibited a wide range of body forms adapted to various lifestyles and environments. they were towering giants or heavily armored beasts, dinosaurs came in an astonishing array of shapes and sizes, each one uniquely adapted to its ecological niche.</li>
<li><strong>The Tyrannosaurus rex, is one of the most iconic and formidable dinosaurs to have ever existed.</strong>often referred to simply as T. rex, Known for its massive size, powerful jaws, and fearsome appearance, T. rex was a top predator of its time during the Late Cretaceous period, around 68 to 66 million years ago.</li>
<li><strong>Dinosaurs exhibited a diverse range of dietary preferences, with some being herbivores and others carnivores.</strong>Herbivorous dinosaurs, such as the mighty Triceratops and gentle Brachiosaurus, fed primarily on plants, using specialized teeth and jaws to grind and process vegetation.</li>
<li><strong>The Triceratops, known for its distinctive appearance, possessed three large horns on its face</strong>These horns, which adorned its brow and nose that undoubtedly played a crucial defensive role in its survival. were formidable weapons against predators such as the fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex.</li>
<li><strong> Velociraptors were small yet highly agile and intelligent predators that roamed the Earth during the Late Cretaceous period.</strong>Despite being only about the size of a turkey, Velociraptors possessed sharp claws on their feet, which they likely used to slash and disembowel their prey.</li>
<li><strong>Stegosaurus, with its distinctive rows of bony plates along its back, remains one of the most recognizable dinosaurs of all time.</strong>One prevailing theory is that the plates were primarily used for thermoregulation, acting as heat exchangers to help regulate the dinosaur’s body temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Pterosaurs were not dinosaurs but rather a group of flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs during the Mesozoic Era.</strong>Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight, with wings formed by a membrane of skin stretched between an elongated fourth finger and the body.</li>
<li><strong>Many dinosaurs, like their modern relatives birds and reptiles, reproduced by laying eggs.</strong>These eggs varied in size, shape, and structure depending on the species of dinosaur. Fossil evidence of dinosaur eggs has been found all over the world, providing valuable insights into their reproductive biology.</li>
<li><strong>Eoraptor holds the distinction of being one of the oldest known dinosaurs discovered to date.</strong>This small, bipedal dinosaur lived during the Late Triassic period, approximately 231 to 228 million years ago. Eoraptor was relatively small in size, measuring about 3 to 4 feet in length, and is believed to have been an early member of the saurischian lineage, which includes both theropods (such as Tyrannosaurus rex) and sauropodomorphs (such as Brachiosaurus).</li>
<li><strong>The study of dinosaurs falls under the broader field of paleontology.</strong>Paleontology is the scientific discipline concerned with the study of prehistoric life forms, including dinosaurs, through the examination of fossils and other remains.</li>
<li><strong>Archaeopteryx, is a fascinating creature that bridges the gap between dinosaurs and modern birds. </strong>often referred to as the “first bird,” Living around 150 million years ago during the Late Jurassic period, Archaeopteryx possessed both avian and reptilian features. Its skeleton showed characteristics of both dinosaurs, such as teeth, a long bony tail, and a bony sternum, and birds, including feathers and wings.</li>
<li><strong>Mary Anning was a remarkable figure in the field of paleontology. </strong>Born in 1799 in Lyme Regis, England, she spent much of her life fossil hunting along the cliffs of the Jurassic Coast. In 1824, when she was just 25 years old, Mary discovered the fossilized remains of what would later be identified as an Ichthyosaurus, a type of marine reptile from the time of the dinosaurs.</li>
<li><strong>Approximately 66 million years ago, a catastrophic event shook the Earth’s ecosystems: an asteroid impact. </strong>This impact, known as the Chicxulub impact, is believed to have triggered a chain reaction of environmental changes that ultimately led to the mass extinction of numerous species, including most non-avian dinosaurs.</li>
<li><strong>Micropachycephalosaurus holds the distinction of having one of the longest names among dinosaurs. </strong>Its name is derived from Greek roots and translates to “small thick-headed lizard.” This dinosaur lived during the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 85 million years ago, in what is now China.</li>
<li><strong>Parasaurolophus, a herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, is renowned for its distinctive cranial crest. </strong>This crest extended backward from its skull and resembled a long, hollow tube. Scientists believe that this cranial structure likely had multiple functions, including communication and display.</li>
<li><strong>Stegosaurus, known for its distinctive double row of bony plates along its back and its spiked tail </strong>had a relatively small brain compared to its massive body size. With a brain approximately the size of a walnut, the Stegosaurus possessed one of the smallest brain-to-body ratios among dinosaurs. Despite its small brain, Stegosaurus was not necessarily unintelligent.</li>
<li><strong>the massive size of dinosaurs like the Brachiosaurus may have posed challenges in supporting their weight on land. </strong>To address this issue, researchers propose the theory that these giants may have spent a significant portion of their time in water.</li>
<li><strong>The Ornithomimus, commonly referred to as the “bird mimic,” was indeed one of the fastest dinosaurs known to have existed. </strong>With its long legs and streamlined body, it is estimated that Ornithomimus could reach speeds of up to 40 miles per hour, making it among the fastest terrestrial animals of its time.</li>
<li><strong>Spinosaurus is believed to have been a semi-aquatic dinosaur, spending a significant amount of its time in water. </strong>Fossil evidence, including its unique adaptations such as its elongated snout, conical teeth, and dense bones, suggests that Spinosaurus was well-suited for a predominantly aquatic lifestyle. It likely hunted for fish and other aquatic prey in rivers, lakes, and coastal regions.</li>
<li><strong>The Microraptor is indeed one of the smallest known dinosaurs, comparable in size to a modern-day crow. </strong>Despite its diminutive stature, the Microraptor was a remarkable creature. It belonged to a group of dinosaurs known as dromaeosaurs, which were closely related to birds.</li>
<li><strong>Maiasaura,  was a herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 76 to 80 million years ago. </strong>whose name translates to “good mother lizard,” This remarkable dinosaur is renowned for its nurturing behavior towards its offspring. Fossil evidence suggests that Maiasaura lived in large herds and nested in colonies, similar to modern-day birds.</li>
<li><strong>Many dinosaurs evolved long necks as an adaptation to reach vegetation high up in trees. </strong>such as the Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus, These sauropod dinosaurs were herbivores, and their towering necks allowed them to browse on leaves and branches that were out of reach for other animals.</li>
<li><strong>Some dinosaurs, such as the Ankylosaurus, were equipped with armor made of bony plates to defend themselves against predators. </strong>Ankylosaurus was a heavily armored herbivore that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 68 to 66 million years ago.</li>
<li><strong>The Iguanodon is the first dinosaurs to be discovered and scientifically described. </strong>In 1822, Gideon Mantell, an English doctor and amateur paleontologist, unearthed fossils of a large, herbivorous dinosaur in Sussex, England.</li>
<li><strong>Scientists have uncovered compelling evidence supporting the idea that birds are direct descendants of small, feathered dinosaurs. </strong>This theory, supported by fossil evidence and genetic studies, suggests that birds evolved from a group of theropod dinosaurs known as maniraptorans during the Mesozoic Era.</li>

//  10 Fun Facts About Niagara Falls

<li><strong>Three falls are better than one.</strong>The fact that we refer to the Falls collectively as “Niagara Falls” leads many to believe that we’re talking about one giant waterfall when, in fact, there are three. The aptly named American Falls are on the U.S. side, as are the lacy Bridal Veil Falls; the Horseshoe Falls are almost entirely on the Canadian side. All three waterfalls can be experienced on the USA side of the Falls.</li>
<li><strong>The Falls are young — geologically speaking.</strong>Niagara Falls was formed from the same glacial-melt activity that formed the Great Lakes at the end of the last Ice Age, some 12,000 years ago. That may seem like eons to us, but it’s just a blink of an eye in the grander scheme!</li>
<li><strong>Speaking of the past: Niagara Falls is America’s oldest state park.</strong>We have an impassioned group of environmentalists to thank for what is today Niagara Falls State Park. (One of those environmentalists? Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, of Central Park fame, who would later design the park). Troubled by the commercial activity occurring on the river, these saviors encouraged New York State to buy up the land surrounding the Falls to keep it safe from exploitation. As a result, in 1885, the park was established as the Niagara Reservation.</li>
<li><strong>It’s not the tallest waterfall in America, but how big is Niagara Falls?</strong>Niagara Falls’ vertical height is over 176 feet in some sections. That’s nothing to scoff at, but it pales in comparison to the continental United States' tallest waterfall, Yosemite Falls, which tops out at 2,425 feet. But what it lacks in vertical size, Niagara Falls makes up for in horizontal size, and in volume: More than 700,000 gallons of water per second pour over Niagara Falls, rushing over at about 25 miles per hour. That makes Niagara Falls the largest in North America by volume and by width.</li>
<li><strong>Yep: That’s a lot of water!</strong>Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron and Erie drain into the mighty Niagara River before emptying into Lake Ontario. Put the five Great Lakes together, and you get the world’s largest freshwater system.</li>
<li><strong>It’s pretty powerful stuff.</strong>Back in 1885, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse created the world’s first hydroelectric power plant in Niagara Falls. These days, the Falls are capable of generating 4 million kilowatts of electricity, which is enough to supply more than a quarter of all the power used in New York State and in Ontario, Canada!</li>
<li><strong>No wonder so many people visit!</strong>More than 8 million visitors explore Niagara Falls State Park annually, coming from all over the world.</li>
<li><strong>… which gives some people crazy ideas.</strong>The first person to go over the Niagara Falls in a barrel was 63-year-old schoolteacher Annie Edson Taylor — she suffered only a concussion and a minor cut on her head. At least a dozen people have survived the plunge; numerous others have lost their lives. (By the way, stunting at Niagara Falls is illegal and includes hefty fines and possible jail time).</li>
<li><strong>Fish, however, fare better than people.</strong>Yes, fish do plunge over the Falls, and it’s estimated that almost all of them survive, thanks to their ability to flow with the water. Sometimes, however, they are a bit “stunned” after making the journey, but those who escape the circling seagulls shake it off and swim away.</li>
<li><strong>Going, going …</strong>The Falls were originally located seven miles downriver near what is now Lewiston; the brink has slowly eroded to its current location. Niagara Falls’ current erosion rate is approximately 1 foot per year and could possibly be reduced to 1 foot per 10 years due to flow control and diversion for hydro-power generation. Eventually, though — likely tens of thousands of years from now — they’ll disappear into Lake Erie.</li>

//  ❌25 MYTH-BUSTING FUN FACTS!✅

<li><strong>Bats Are Blind ❌</strong>Contrary to the myth, bats can see. Many species have good night vision and can even see in daylight. In fact, they use echolocation to navigate, emitting high-frequency sounds and interpreting the echoes to locate prey and objects in complete darkness.</li>
<li><strong>Goldfish Have Three-Second Memories ❌</strong>The idea that goldfish have incredibly short memories is a popular misconception. In reality, goldfish can remember things for months, not just seconds, and they can even learn and remember simple tricks or routines with regular training.</li>
<li><strong>Lightning Never Strikes the Same Place Twice ❌</strong>The notion that lightning doesn't strike the same place twice is a myth. Lightning can and does strike the same place multiple times, particularly tall structures or objects that provide a path of least resistance for the electrical discharge.</li>
<li><strong>The Great Wall of China is Visible from Space ❌</strong>While the Great Wall of China is an impressive structure, it's not visible to the naked eye from space. Astronauts can spot it with the aid of binoculars or cameras, but its width and color make it difficult to distinguish from other features on Earth's surface.</li>
<li><strong>Bananas Grow on Trees ❌</strong>Although banana plants may resemble trees, they are technically large herbaceous plants. Unlike trees, they don't have a woody trunk, and the so-called "trunk" is a pseudostem formed by tightly packed leaf bases. Bananas are one of the largest herbaceous plants globally, known for their delicious fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Bulls Hate the Color Red ❌</strong>The popular belief that bulls are enraged by the color red is a misconception. Bulls are color-blind to red. They charge at the movement of the matador's cape, not its color. The traditional red color of the cape is chosen for theatrical purposes, not for the bull's reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Humans Only Use 10% of Their Brains ❌</strong>The myth that humans use only 10% of their brains is inaccurate. We use all parts of our brain, just not all at once.

<li><strong>The Five Senses Are the Only Senses ❌</strong>Contrary to the belief that we have only five senses, humans have more than five senses, including balance, temperature, and pain senses. Beyond the traditional senses of sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell, these additional senses help us navigate and understand the world around us.</li>
<li><strong>Cracking Knuckles Causes Arthritis ❌</strong>Many people believe that cracking knuckles can lead to arthritis, but there's no scientific evidence to support this claim.

The idea of his short stature likely stems from British propaganda during the Napoleonic Wars.</li>

<li><strong>You Lose Most of Your Body Heat Through Your Head ❌</strong>The misconception that you lose most of your body heat through your head has been debunked.

<li><strong>Lemmings Commit Mass Suicide ❌</strong>The belief that lemmings commit mass suicide by jumping off cliffs is a misconception.

Several inventors, such as Sir Humphry Davy and Warren de la Rue, had already created incandescent lamps before Edison's version.</li>

These streets invite you to take intimate walks next to colourful houses, small coffee shops and vintage boutiques.</li>

Because, we've certainly perfected the craft of pastries. Just saying. </li>
<li><strong>How's this for a fun fact about Denmark? We don't have any mountains!</strong>Denmark is known around the world for its bike culture, and the fact that our country is quite flat is definitely an advantage in this matter - we never have to bike uphill! But we also have more than 12,000km of cycle tracks and lanes throughout the country which makes biking in Denmark a safe and respected way to travel. We even enjoy cycling so much that 75% continue biking all through winter and we have a Cycling Embassy.</li>
<li><strong>More than 50% of Copenhageners cycle to and from work every day</strong>Copenhageners cycle an average of 3km every day and this adds up to people cycling 35 times around the world every day in Copenhagen!

<li><strong>We have some weird Danish traditions</strong>We don't mind admitting that some of our Danish traditions seem rather weird to the modern eye, as they include batting at a black cat in a barrel at the annual carnival "fastelavn" and burning a witch on a bonfire at Sankt Hans (midsummer's eve). But don't worry, we've toned down the craziness a bit, so nowadays the barrels are simply decorated with cut out versions of black cats and the bonfires only burn doll versions of witches. Phew.</li>

//  10 fun facts about your brain

<li><strong>The average adult human brain weighs three pounds and has a texture like firm jelly.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Every time your heart beats, your arteries carry 20-25% of your blood to the brain.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Every time you recall a memory or have a new thought, you create a connection in the brain.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Although 100 billion neurons (nerve cells) are in the brain, they make up only 10% of it.</strong>These neurons branch out to 100 trillion-plus trigger points, forming what experts call a “neuron forest.”</li>
<li><strong>Size doesn’t matter in the brain.</strong>There is no evidence that a larger brain is smarter than a smaller brain.</li>
<li><strong>The brain has 100,000 miles of blood vessels.</strong>The distance around the world at the equator is 24,900 miles.</li>
<li><strong>Did you know that it is normal for your mind to wander</strong>A joint study by Harvard University, Dartmouth College and the University of Aberdeen in Scotland found the parts of the brain that control “task-unrelated thought” (such as daydreaming) are almost always active when the brain is at rest.</li>
<li><strong>Adults who participated in mind-challenging activities were 63% less likely to develop dementia.</strong>According to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine.</li>
<li><strong>Women who are highly physically fit are 90% less likely to develop dementia</strong>Research has shown women who are highly physically fit are 90% less likely to develop dementia than women who are moderately physically fit.</li>

//  13 Awesome Facts About Bats

<li><strong>There are over 1,400 species of bats worldwide.</strong>Bats can be found on nearly every part of the planet except in extreme deserts and polar regions. The difference in size and shape are equally impressive. Bats range in size from the Kitti’s hog-nosed bat (also called the Bumblebee Bat) that weighs less than a penny — making it the world’s smallest mammal — to the flying foxes, which can have a wingspan of up to 6 feet. The U.S. and Canada are home to about 45 species of bats and additional species are found in the U.S. territories in the Pacific and Caribbean.</li>
<li><strong>Not all bats hibernate.</strong>Even though bears and bats are the two most well-known hibernators, not all bats spend their winter in caves. Some bat species like the spotted bat survive by migrating in search of food to warmer areas when it gets chilly. </li>
<li><strong>Bats have few natural predators — disease is one of the biggest threats.</strong>Owls, hawks and snakes eat bats, but that’s nothing compared to the millions of bats dying from white-nose syndrome. The disease — named for a white fungus on the muzzle and wings of bats — affects hibernating bats and has been detected in 37 states and seven Canadian provinces. This deadly syndrome has decimated certain species more than others. It has killed over 90% of northern long-eared, little brown and tri-colored bat populations in fewer than 10 years. Scientists are working to understand the disease. You can help by avoiding places where bats are hibernating. If you do go underground, decontaminate your clothing, footwear and gear to help with not spreading this disease to other areas. </li>
<li><strong>Without bats, say goodbye to bananas, avocados and mangoes.</strong>Over 300 species of fruit depend on bats for pollination. Bats help spread seeds for nuts, figs and cacao — the main ingredient in chocolate. Without bats, we also wouldn’t have plants like agave or the iconic saguaro cactus. </li>
<li><strong>Night insects have the most to fear from bats.</strong>Each night, bats can eat their body weight in insects, numbering in the thousands! This insect-heavy diet helps foresters and farmers protect their crops from pests.</li>
<li><strong>Bats are the only flying mammal.</strong>While the flying squirrel can only glide for short distances, bats are true fliers. A bat’s wing resembles a modified human hand — imagine the skin between your fingers larger, thinner and stretched. This flexible skin membrane that extends between each long finger bone and many movable joints make bats agile fliers.</li>
<li><strong>Bats may be small, but they’re fast little creatures.</strong>How fast a bat flies depends on the species, but they can reach speeds over 100 miles per hour according to new research. </li>
<li><strong>Conservation efforts are helping bat species recover.</strong>At least 12 types of U.S. bats are endangered, and more are threatened. These amazing animals face a multitude of threats including habitat loss and disease, but we're working to change that. A unique international conservation partnership in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico has been working to help one species, the lesser long-nosed bat, recover to the point it can be removed from the Endangered Species list. In 1988, there were thought to be fewer than 1,000 bats at the 14 known roosts range wide. There are now an estimated 200,000 bats at 75 roosts! </li>
<li><strong>The longest-living bat is 41 years old.</strong>It’s said that the smaller the animal, the shorter its lifespan, but bats break that rule of longevity. Although most bats live less than 20 years in the wild, scientists have documented six species that life more than 30 years. In 2006, a tiny bat from Siberia set the world record at 41 years.</li>
<li><strong> Like cats, bats clean themselves.</strong>Far from being dirty, bats spend a lot of time grooming themselves. Some, like the Colonial bat, even groom each other. Besides having sleek fur, cleaning also helps control parasites.</li>
<li><strong>Dogs aren’t the only ones with pups. Baby bats are called pups, and a group of bats is a colony.</strong>Like other mammals, mother bats feed their pups breastmilk, not insects. Most bats give birth to a single pup! There is at least one species that commonly has twins and that is the eastern red bat. Momma bats form nursery colonies in spring in caves, dead trees and rock crevices.</li>
<li><strong>Bats are inspiring medical marvels.</strong>About 80 medicines come from plants that rely on bats for their survival. While bats are not blind, studying how bats use echolocation has helped scientists develop navigational aids for the blind. Research on bats has also led to advances in vaccines.</li>
<li><strong>he Mexican long-tongued bat is a vital pollinator in desert systems.</strong>They have a long, bristle-like tongue, allowing them to sip nectar from agave and cacti.</li>
<li><strong>Innies or Outies? Humans aren’t the only ones with belly buttons.</strong>With a few exceptions, nearly all mammals have navels because of mom’s umbilical cord, and bats are no different. Now the real question is: Innies or outies?</li>

//  10 Facts About Taylor Swift

<li><strong>Taylor Swift is named after James Taylor, one of her parents’ favorite artists.</strong>Her mother thought that giving her a gender-neutral name would help her forge a business career someday. Though Swift needed no help in that department, the two artists have performed together before, duetting James Taylor’s hit “Fire and Rain” and Taylor Swift’s “Love Story” in 2012. The connection also spawned a hilarious reaction from Taylor Swift when she won the Best Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award for 1989 and asked if James Taylor was in the audience. You can see the video below, starting at 0:50.</li>
<li><strong>She grew up on a Christmas tree farm in Reading, PA (which inspired her song “Christmas Tree Farm”).</strong>Her job was to pick praying mantis pods off the trees before they were sold.</li>
<li><strong>Swift’s first CD was by LeAnn Rimes, purchased when she was just six years old.</strong>According to an interview with LeAnn Rimes, “She [Taylor] used to come to my shows when she was really little, which is crazy.” Though the duo has never collaborated, Rimes seems open to it!</li>
<li><strong>She wrote “Our Song,” a single on her debut album, for her high school talent show.</strong>It’s hard to believe Swift wrote such a catchy tune for her ninth-grade talent show! According to Liv Simpson’s book on the artist, Swift chose “Our Song” as her debut album’s closing track because she thought the last line, “play it again,” would encourage listeners to replay the album.</li>
<li><strong>The day before her Reputation tour began in 2018, she invited 2,000 adopted and foster children to a private dress rehearsal.</strong>In May 2018, Swift played a two-hour show for the children, along with their parents and caregivers, in Arizona. She also stayed for an extra three hours after the show to take photos, sign autographs, and treat fans to a pizza party!</li>
<li><strong>It only took 15 minutes for Taylor Swift and Liz Rose to write the song “Tim McGraw.”</strong>They wrote the song together when Swift was still in high school. The singer is quoted as saying, “The concept for this song hit me because I was dating a guy who moved away, and it was going to be over for us. So, I started thinking of things that I knew would remind him of me. The first thing that came to mind was that my favorite song is by Tim McGraw. After school, I went downtown, sat down at the piano, and wrote this with Liz Rose in 15 minutes. It may be the best 15 minutes I’ve ever experienced.”</li>
<li><strong>Her grandmother, Marjorie, was an opera singer.</strong>After winning a talent contest in 1950, Swift’s maternal grandmother Marjorie Finlay toured on the ABC radio network show, Music With the Girls. Swift has been influenced throughout the years by her grandmother, releasing “Marjorie” in 2020, which featured Finlay’s backing vocals.</li>
<li><strong>Speak Now was the first album Swift wrote entirely on her own.</strong>Taylor Swift’s third studio album, Speak Now, was written entirely on her own, partially due to her intense touring schedule. The album was a departure from her previous, more youthful and fairytale-inspired album, Fearless, and provided a deeper, introspective look at relationships and even media criticism.</li>
<li><strong>Her album Lover was originally going to be called Daylight.</strong>Though both the tracks “Lover” and “Daylight” ended up on her seventh album, Swift mentioned in an interview with Ryan Seacrest that she, “almost called the album Daylight […] but I felt like that was a little too on the nose. […] It’s an album about all different forms of love. Even when love hurts, this album is about the full spectrum that love makes us feel, so I was like, this album is definitely going to be called Lover.” The album does end with “Daylight,” which fans seem to agree is the perfect way to sum up getting through tumultuous times of love to end up in the light together.</li>
<li><strong>The 2019 film, Someone Great, helped inspire the song “Death By a Thousand Cuts.”</strong></li>

//  14 fascinating facts about giraffe:

<li><strong>There are four distinct species of giraffe</strong>Northern giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis, Southern giraffe giraffa, Reticulated giraffe G. reticulata and Masai giraffe G. tippelskirchi.</li>
<li><strong>Giraffe are already extinct in at least seven countries in Africa.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Just like human fingerprints, no two giraffe have the same coat pattern.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Giraffe feet are the size of a dinner plate with a diameter of 30 cm.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Giraffe tongues are bluish-purple and between 45 and 50 cm long.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Both male and female giraffe have horns already at birth.</strong>These ossicones lie flat and are not attached to the skull to avoid injury at birth. They only fuse with the skull later in life.</li>
<li><strong>The giraffe is the tallest mammal in the world. Even newborn giraffe are taller than most humans.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Female giraffe give birth standing up. </strong>Their young fall about 2 m to the ground and can stand up within an hour of birth.</li>
<li><strong>In some populations, over 50% of all giraffe calves do not survive their first year.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A giraffe’s neck is too short to reach the ground.</strong>To drink, giraffe first have to splay their forelegs and/or bend their knees, and only then can they lower their necks to reach the surface of the water.</li>
<li><strong>Giraffe only drink once every few days.</strong>Even when water is readily available, evidence shows that many giraffe do not drink regularly – sometimes not at all.</li>
<li><strong>To protect the giraffe’s brain from sudden changes in blood pressure when it drinks</strong>the jugular veins have incredibly elastic walls and large one-way valves that allow the veins to expand significantly and prevent the blood from flowing back to the brain when the giraffe’s head is lowered.</li>
<li><strong>Alternatively, to help fight gravity when blood returns to the heart from a giraffe’s feet</strong>their blood vessels are thickly walled and muscled, and the skin on the legs is so tight it acts like giant compression socks. These unique adaptations have been studied by scientists at NASA to get inspiration for human space suits.</li>
<li><strong>A giraffe heart weighs approximately 11 kilograms (almost 25 pounds).</strong>While people thought that the giraffe had a larger heart compared to other mammals to pump blood around its body, this is not true. Rather the giraffe’s heart has a thicker muscle on the left side (ventricle) of the heart so it can generate enough force to fight gravity.</li>

// 8 TURKEY FACT

<li><strong>Enough with gobble, gobble. Turkeys also cluck and purr.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Turkey droppings tell a bird’s sex and age.</strong>Male droppings are j-shaped; female droppings are spiral-shaped. The larger the diameter, the older the bird.  </li>
<li><strong>Feathers galore: An adult turkey has 5,000 to 6,000 feathers — count them!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tom turkeys aren’t the only ones that swagger and fan their tail feathers to woo mates and ward off rivals.</strong>Some hens strut, too.  </li>
<li><strong>Young turkeys — called poults — scarf down insects like candy.</strong>Poults develop more of a taste for plants after they’re four weeks old.</li>
<li><strong>They may look off-kilter — tilting their heads and staring at the sky — yet they’re fast.</strong>Turkeys can clock 18 miles per hour on foot and up to 50 miles per hour in flight.</li>
<li><strong>Ben Franklin called the wild turkey a “bird of courage” and thought it would make a better national symbol.</strong>Move over, American bald eagle.</li>
<li><strong>In the early 1900s, wild turkeys were on the brink of extinction, with only about 200,000 left.</strong>Through conservation efforts over the past century, with funds derived from the Pittman-Robertson Act, and thanks to sportsmen and women, there are approximately 6.5 million wild birds in the United States today, according to the National Wild Turkey Federation.</li>

//  16 Surprising Facts About Your Heart

<li><strong>Your heart can weigh between 7 and 15 ounces.</strong>A man’s heart weighs, on average, around 10 ounces and a woman’s heart weighs around 8 ounces.</li>
<li><strong>Newborn babies have the fastest heart beats.</strong>A ewborn’s heart rate is around 70 to 190 beats per minute. The average adult should have a resting heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute. If your resting heart rate is higher or increases over several years, it could be a sign of current or impending heart problems. Athletes, who regularly train, will have a very slow resting heart rate around 40 to 60 beats per minute. Women also have faster heart rates, on average, than men because their hearts are smaller in size and need to beat more to pump the same amount of blood.</li>
<li><strong>Your heart is located in the middle of your chest.</strong>It’s found behind your breastbone, but it’s tilted to the left, which makes it easier to feel on that side of your chest.</li>
<li><strong>Your heart beats around 100,000 times a day.</strong>The average, healthy human heart beats around 100,000 times per day to pump blood through your body. The sound you hear when your heart beats is actually the noise of the heart valves opening and closing. </li>
<li><strong>Your heart pumps 2,000 gallons of blood a day.</strong>The 2,000 gallons of blood that your heart pumps every day travels about 12,000 miles through your body each day, which is four times the size of the U.S. from coast to coast. During your lifetime, you pump about one million barrels of blood.</li>
<li><strong>Heart attacks happen most often on Monday mornings.</strong>Stress hormones are higher in the mornings than at any other point during the day, and Mondays in particular seem to cause people more stress than other days of the week. A rise in blood pressure, plus an increase in heart rate and stress hormones can break pockets of plaque and cause a blockage to the heart.</li>
<li><strong>There are 60,000 miles of blood vessels in your body.</strong>If one of the vessels is damaged, it makes your heart have to work harder to pump your blood.</li>
<li><strong>No one knows why the heart is associated with love.</strong>Different civilizations and historical time periods had different meanings for the heart. The belief that the heart controlled all thought and emotion was the general assumption in ancient civilizations. They also believed that the brain was completely useless. Over time, the idea that love came from the heart stuck in popular culture.</li>
<li><strong>Men and women have different heart attack symptoms.</strong>The symptoms of a woman having a heart attack are much less prominent than a man. For women, heart attacks can feel like uncomfortable squeezing, pressure, fullness or pain in the center of the chest. It can also produce pain in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach, shortness of breath, nausea and other symptoms. Men experience the typical heart attack symptoms of chest pain, discomfort and pressure. They, too, can experience pain in other areas, such as the arms, neck, back and jaw, as well as shortness of breath, sweating and discomfort that mimics heartburn.</li>
<li><strong>Laughing is good for your heart.</strong>Laughing has many, proven health benefits. Studies have shown that your blood vessels relax when you’re laughing, which sends 20% more blood through your body. Relaxed blood vessels mean your heart doesn’t have to work as hard.</li>
<li><strong>The heart works twice as hard as the leg muscles of a sprinter.</strong>It takes a lot of force to move your blood around your body, and that is why a strong, healthy heart is so important. The heart, which is a muscle, has twice the power of the leg muscles of someone sprinting.</li>
<li><strong>Sneezing does not stop your heart.</strong>Contrary to popular belief, sneezing does not stop your heart or make it “skip a beat.” It can, however, briefly change your heart’s rhythm. The only time your heart stops is during cardiac arrest.</li>
<li><strong>Your aorta is as large as a garden hose.</strong>The biggest artery in your body, the aorta, runs from your heart to your belly. It carries the most blood and is also the most common sight for problems like aneurysms.</li>
<li><strong>A “broken heart” can feel like a heart attack.</strong>Intense and sudden feelings of sadness can mimic the symptoms of a heart attack, also known as "broken heart syndrome." Stress hormones are released into the body and can cause chest pain and shortness of breath. Luckily, with a little bit of rest, your heart will begin to feel normal.</li>
<li><strong>Some capillaries are ten times smaller than a human hair.</strong>They are so small that blood cells have to travel single-file through them. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged through the very thin walls of the capillaries. </li>
<li><strong>Horses can mirror a human’s heart rate.</strong>A study showed that a horse can mimic the heart rate of the person touching them. Along with dogs and cats, horses have been added to the list of animals that are emotionally responsive to humans, and they may one day be used to detect stress hormones in patients.</li>

<li><strong>It has 24 hours of darkness — and beautiful lights.</strong>Iceland is located near the Arctic Circle; as a result, the country experiences long summer days and perpetually dark winter nights. Did you know that Iceland experiences up to 23 hours of darkness during the month of December and approximately 22 to 24 hours of daylight in the month of June? If you've ever wanted to experience the famous "midnight sun," when the sun remains visible as late as midnight, or stand beneath the sparkling northern lights, this is the place to be.</li>
<li><strong>It's lush with Viking lore.</strong>Settled by Norse Vikings who arrived from Norway in the 800s CE, Iceland has a unique cultural background full of history and colorful tales. Even Icelandic horses have been bred from Vikings' horses that were brought over from mainland Europe hundreds of years ago.</li>
<li><strong>Its tectonic plates are visible.</strong>Þingvellir (pronounced "Thingvellir"), Iceland, is one of only a few destinations across the globe where you can easily see two tectonic plates drifting apart above sea level.</li>
<li><strong>It's home to as many people as St. Louis.</strong>There are approximately 320,000 people living in the country of Iceland — that's about the size of St. Louis, Missouri. Over two thirds of the population resides in and around the northernmost capital in the world, Reykjavík. How's that for a close-knit community?</li>
<li><strong>It's a hot spot.</strong>Iceland is considered geologically active, with approximately 130 volcanic mountains, about 30 of which are still active today. Even the slightest change in the country's geology could awaken some of the most dormant volcanoes. Currently, one volcanic eruption occurs every four to five years, on average. As a result, several parts of Iceland are covered in lava fields.</li>
<li><strong>Its prohibition period completely ended in 1989.</strong>Like the United States during the Roaring Twenties, Iceland went through a strict prohibition period from 1915 to 1922. The law was then loosened to allow for Spanish wine, and in 1935, all spirits were legalized — with the caveat that beer with an alcohol percentage of 2.25 or higher could still not be consumed. It wasn't until the spring of 1989 that the ban on strong beer was finally lifted. To commemorate the reversal of prohibition, some Icelanders celebrate Beer Day, which takes place annually on March 1.</li>
<li><strong>It's said that elves live there.</strong>Much of the Icelandic population believes in huldufólk (hidden people). Many subscribe to the belief that huldufólk, who can be best thought of as elves, exist and dwell among Icelanders. This belief has deep, strong roots that still show themselves in the present culture: In some cases, the construction of new businesses has been halted due to a fear that bulldozers might destroy an elvish home or community.</li>
<li><strong>Its southernmost point is the youngest place on earth.</strong>Located among the Westman Islands is the island of Surtsey — thought to be the youngest place on earth. This UNESCO World Heritage site and volcanic island was formed in 1963 as the result of volcanic eruptions.</li>
<li><strong>It has a strict gun policy.</strong>In Iceland, the police department — with the exception of a special force called the Viking Squad — does not carry guns; they're armed with pepper spray and batons when they need to confront crime. Although approximately 90,000 citizens own guns, there is very little crime in Iceland and guns are primarily used for licensed hunting and sport.</li>
<li><strong>Its residents enjoy extraordinary quality of life.</strong>The country is home to some of the most technologically advanced companies in the world. And while Icelanders are known for their longer (43- to 44-hour) work weeks, they also possess one of the longest life expectancy rates (Iceland is also famous for its exemplary literacy rates).</li>

//  15 Facts About Bison

<li><strong>Bison are the largest mammal in North America.</strong>Male bison (called bulls) weigh up to 2,000 pounds and stand 6 feet tall, while females (called cows) weigh up to 1,000 pounds and reach a height of 4-5 feet. Bison calves weigh 30-70 pounds at birth. </li> 
<li><strong>Since the late 19th century, Interior has been the primary national conservation steward of the bison.</strong>Public lands managed by Interior support 17 bison herds—or approximately 10,000 bison—in 12 states, including Alaska. This is about one-third of all wild bison in North America.</li>
<li><strong>What’s the difference between bison and buffalo?</strong>While bison and buffalo are used interchangeably, in North America the scientific name is bison. Actually, it’s Bison bison bison (genus: Bison, species: bison, subspecies: bison or athabascae), but only saying it once is fine. Historians believe the term “buffalo” grew from the French word for beef, “boeuf.”</li> 
<li><strong>Yellowstone National Park is the only place in the U.S. where bison have continuously lived since prehistoric times.</strong>What makes Yellowstone’s bison so special is that they’re the descendants of early bison that roamed our country’s grasslands. In 2021, Yellowstone’s bison population was estimated at 5,450—making it the largest bison population on public lands. This population is allowed to roam relatively freely over the expansive landscape of Yellowstone National Park and some nearby areas of Montana.</li> 
<li><strong>What’s a “red dog”? It’s a baby bison.</strong>Bison calves tend to be born from late March through May and are orange-red in color, earning them the nickname “red dogs.” After a few months, their hair starts to change to dark brown and their characteristic shoulder hump and horns begin to grow.</li> 
<li><strong>The history of bison and Native Americans are intertwined.</strong>Bison have been integral to Tribal culture, providing them with food, clothing, fuel, tools, shelter and spiritual value. Established in 1992, the Inter Tribal Buffalo Council works with the National Park Service to transfer bison from national park lands to Tribal lands.</li>
<li><strong>You can judge a bison’s mood by its tail. </strong>When it hangs down and switches naturally, the bison is usually calm. If the tail is standing straight up, watch out! It may be ready to charge. No matter what a bison’s tail is doing, remember that they are unpredictable and can charge at any moment. Every year, there are regrettable accidents caused by people getting too close to these massive animals. It’s great to love the bison but love them from a distance.</li>
<li><strong>Wind Cave National Park’s herd helped revive bison populations around the country.</strong>The story starts in 1905 with the formation of the American Bison Society and a breeding program at the New York City Zoo (today, the Bronx Zoo). By 1913, the American Bison Society had enough bison to restore a free-ranging bison herd. Working with Interior, they donated 14 bison to Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota. More than 100 years later, the bison from Wind Cave have helped reestablishing other herds across the United States and most recently in Mexico.</li>
<li><strong>Bison may be big, but they’re also fast.</strong>They can run up to 35 miles per hour. Plus, they’re extremely agile. Bison can spin around quickly, jump high fences and are strong swimmers.</li>
<li><strong>Bison primarily eat grasses, weeds and leafy plants—typically foraging for nine to 11 hours a day.</strong>That’s where the bison’s large protruding shoulder hump comes in handy during the winter. It allows them to swing their heads from side-to-side to clear snow—especially for creating foraging patches. Learn how bison's feeding habits can help ensure diversity of prairie plant species especially after a fire.</li>
<li><strong>From hunter to conservationist, Teddy Roosevelt helped save bison from extinction.</strong>In 1883, Teddy Roosevelt traveled to the Dakota Territory to hunt bison. After spending a few years in the west, Roosevelt returned to New York with a new outlook on life. He paved the way for the conservation movement, and in 1905, formed the American Bison Society with William Hornaday to save the disappearing bison. Today bison live in all 50 states, including Tribal lands, wildlife refuges, national parks and private lands.</li> 
<li><strong>Bison can live up to 20 years old.</strong>The average lifespan for a bison is 10–20 years, but some live to be older. Cows begin breeding at the age of two and only have one baby at a time. For males, the prime breeding age is six to 10 years. Learn how Interior works to ensure genetic diversity and long-term viability of bison.</li>
<li><strong>A little dirt won’t hurt.</strong>Called wallowing, bison roll in the dirt to deter biting flies and help shed fur. Male bison also wallow during mating season to leave behind their scent and display their strength.</li>
<li><strong>The American bison’s ancestors can be traced to southern Asia thousands of years ago.</strong>Bison made their way to America by crossing the ancient land bridge that once connected Asia with North America during the Pliocene Epoch, some 400,000 years ago. These ancient animals were much larger than the iconic bison we love today. Fossil records show that one prehistoric bison, Bison latiforns, had horns measuring 9 feet from tip to tip.</li>
<li><strong>While bison have poor eyesight, they have excellent senses of smell and hearing.</strong>Cows and calves communicate using pig-like grunts, and during mating season, bulls can be heard bellowing across long distances.</li>
