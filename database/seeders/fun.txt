10 interesting facts about Mongolia that will surprise you

1. There are almost as many people as horses in Mongolia
Mongolia is the 19th largest country in the world. It is also one of the countries with the lowest population density. Mongolia is mostly made up of steppes, deserts and mountains. There are 3.2 million people and roughly the same number of horses. The saying “a Mongol without a horse is like a bird without wings” explains a lot.

2. The sun here will not warm you up that much
You may know that Mongolia is often called the "land of blue sky". The climate here is dry and not very rich in clouds and precipitation. The sun shines up to 250 days a year in Mongolia, but you will not enjoy many warm days here due to the high altitude and continental climate. Summer only lasts a few weeks. If you visit in months other than July and June, be sure to bring a jacket. Winter in Mongolia is long and temperatures drop to minus 35 degrees Celsius.

horses from Mongolia are welk-known

3. Ice cream is a traditional winter delicacy for locals
Are you one of those who cannot resist ice cream in the summer heat? In Mongolia, ice cream is a common street snack in winter. During the cold months, the stallholders do not need to have a freezer, as the temperature here drops to minus 30 degrees Celsius, so they just need paper boxes.

4. More than a quarter of Mongolians are nomads
Mongolian nomads are one of the last nomadic peoples in the world. More than 25 per cent of the total population are nomads. The people here live in harmony with nature and move their animals according to the seasons.

If you visit a nomadic community, you will be surprised by their friendliness. The yurts, as their tents are called, do not have bells. That is because you can walk in without hesitation and you will be greeted with something to eat as soon as you arrive. They will probably also give you a taste of fermented horse milk which they call airag.

5. Mongolia is home to the snow leopard and the two-humped camel
If you decide to visit this beautiful country, you may see several endangered species, including the snow leopard. Although they are not particularly aggressive towards humans, you should be careful. The snow leopard makes no sound to alert you to its presence.

You may also come across the two-humped camel, which was once used extensively on the Silk Road because of its resistance to cold and drought. Like the leopard, the camels here are also endangered. Mongolia hosts an annual camel festival where people can get up close and personal with these creatures.

6. Mongolia has its own Olympics
Have you heard about the Naadam festival? This event has a long tradition that takes place every summer in all major cities in Mongolia. The most important sports events of the Naadam include three disciplines: archery, horse riding and wrestling.  The festival also includes traditional Mongolian music and dance. For locals, this is one of the most important social and sporting events of the year.

7. You will find the second largest desert in Asia here
Gobi Desert is the second largest desert in Asia and the sixth largest in the world, and is located in the southern part of Mongolia along the border with China. In total, it occupies about 30 per cent of Mongolia's total land area. Sand dunes cover only a fraction of the Gobi; the surface of this desert is largely made up of rocks. This desert is also considered to be the largest site of dinosaur fossils in the world.

8. The locals are abandoning their traditional nomadic life and moving to the cities due to dzud
The phenomenon of dzud has been part of Mongolia for a long time. Dzud means a very long and cold winter in which large numbers of cattle die. A winter rich in snow is a problem for animals that are unable to reach the grass. But if it does not snow at all, challenges also arise. For graziers and animals, snow is an important source of water. For the local economy, which depends on this way of life, dzud can mean a food and economic crisis. Many nomads who have lost their herds in this way will have no choice but to move to the cities.

Many animals die due to dzud

9. From the diary of a humanitarian: you can be a taxi driver too
Taxis are the most common mode of transport in Mongolian cities. Jana Žilková, the country director at Caritas Czech Republic in Mongolia, describes the situation as follows: “Just stick your hand out of the window and within minutes you have a customer. People here often use shared taxis on their way to work or home. It's also an easy way for many locals to earn money."

10. Did you know that Caritas Czech Republic supports people in Mongolia?
In Mongolia, where Caritas has been working since 2007, we focus mainly on environmental protection. Although Mongolia has beautiful nature, the country is also plagued by excessive plastic waste, which is hardly recycled. We pass on our experience from the Czech Republic, educate children in schools about the importance of sorting waste and support local organisations that want to save Mongolia from plastic pollution.

Mongolia is also a young country, with people under 35 making up more than a third of the population. Our activities therefore also focus on the personal development of young people and their active involvement in society.

14 Fun Facts About Trees
Trees are more than just part of our natural landscape. They provide shelter and food for wildlife. They absorb carbon dioxide and produce breathable air. And one of the best things about trees is that they add to the beauty of the world.
 
1. Trees are the longest living organisms on Earth, and never die of old age.
California holds the record for the oldest living trees. Some of the state’s bristlecone pines and giant sequoias are 4,000-5,000 years old. Methuselah, an estimated 4,852-year-old ancient Bristlecone Pine, is one of the oldest living trees in the world.

 

tree rings2

2. Tree rings can predict climate change.
Dating a tree by studying its rings is called Dendrochronology. However, a tree’s rings don’t only reveal its age, they can also indicate the occurrence of natural disasters such as a volcanic eruption or a drought event. In the years of good growth, characterized by a healthy supply of resources, the ring is thick. It is thin when resources are scarce in the ecosystem. A study by Somaru Ram from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology showed that the increasing heat index and temperature in Sikkim, India has had an adverse effect on tree growth due to high potential evapotranspiration—the rate at which plants lose water through their leaves. Such studies help scientists understand the impact of climate change.

 

3. Planting trees can help reduce your energy costs.shade
Strategically planting trees and shrubs can save you up to 25 percent on your energy bills. A shade tree can help cool your home by as much as 20 degrees in the summertime. Not only do they provide shade in the summer, but serve as a windbreak in the winter, too.

 

4. Some trees have been to the moon.
“Moon trees'' were grown from seeds taken to the moon during the Apollo 14 mission in early 1971. NASA and the US Forest Service wanted to see if the moon’s orbit caused the seeds to grow differently back on earth. These trees were donated to state forestry services in 1975 and 1976.

 

5. Trees are able to communicate and defend themselves against attacking insects.
Scientists have found that trees can flood their leaves with chemicals called phenolics when the insects begin their raid. They can also signal danger to other trees so they can start their own defense. Willow trees, for example, emit certain chemicals when they’re attacked by webworms. Other willows then produce more tannin, making their leaves harder for the pests to digest.

 

6. Trees block noise by reducing sound waves.
They reduce noise through a phenomenon called sound attenuation, which is the reduction of sound intensity. Leaves, twigs, and branches on trees, shrubs, and herbaceous growth absorb and deflect sound waves to mask unwanted noise.

 

hiking7. Trees can help to reduce stress.
Research suggests that being around trees is good for our mental and social well-being. A study conducted by the University of Illinois and the University of Hong Kong found that the denser the forest, the lower the stress, which suggests that taking a walk down a tree-lined street could prove beneficial to your mental wellbeing. Research also suggests that nature experiences help us to feel kinder toward others. This is partly because they release chemicals called phytoncides. When we breathe them in, it can reduce blood pressure, lower anxiety levels, and increase pain threshold.

 

8. Trees help reduce the effects of climate change.
A mature tree can absorb more than 48 pounds of carbon dioxide each year, removing and storing the carbon while releasing the oxygen back into the air. In Chicago, trees remove more than 18,000 tons of air pollution each year.

 

9. Trees can help you find your way if you get lost in the woods.moss
In northern temperate climates, moss will grow on the northern side of the tree trunk, where there is more shade. Also, a tree’s rings can help point you in the right direction too. If you’re in the northern hemisphere, you can see the rings of the tree grow slightly thicker on the southern side since it receives more light.  In the southern hemisphere, the opposite is true, with rings being thicker on the north side.

 

10. More than half of all tree species exist in only one country.
There are 60,000 tree species in the world and many are threatened with extinction. Brazil, Colombia, and Indonesia have the highest totals for native tree species.

 

neighborhood11. Well-kept landscapes with trees increase property value.
Several recent nationwide surveys show that mature trees in a well-landscaped yard can increase the value of a house by seven to 19 percent. A study by a Michigan State professor found that across seven different states, study participants perceived that home value increased from five to 11% for homes with a good landscape.

 

12. If a birdhouse is hung on a tree branch, it won’t move up the tree as the tree grows.birdhouse2
This is because trees grow from the top. Specialized cells in the ends of the tree shoots form areas called meristems. These meristems are the locations from which a tree grows taller and limbs grow longer. Because trees grow from their most distal ends, it means that a branch will always be the same height as it was the day it emerged from the trunk as a little bud. However, just because tree branches do not rise as a tree grows doesn’t mean they will always be there, many trees shed their lowest branches as they grow.

 

Untitled design 113. Trees improve water quality.
As rain falls to the Earth, it is slowed and filtered by trees, helping it soak into the soil. Trees then serve as natural sponges, collecting and filtering rainwater and releasing it slowly into streams and rivers. They also prevent soil from eroding into our waterways, reduce stormwater runoff, and lessen flood damage.

 

14. Different parts of a tree grow at different times throughout the year.
Typically, most of the foliage growth happens in the spring, followed by trunk growth in the summer and root growth in the fall and winter.

10 fun facts about sheep

1. Counting sheep? There are hundreds of different breeds!
There are over 1,200 breeds of domestic sheep. With all these different breeds, some unique characteristics exist. Some breeds of sheep, like the Hebridean, grow two, four, or even six horns! Racka sheep are unique because males and females have long, spiral-shaped horns. Najdi sheep have long, silky hair rather than curly wool like other sheep breeds.

From left to right, photo of a Hebridean sheep, Racka sheep and Najdi sheep.
From left to right, a Hebridean sheep, a Racka sheep and a Najdi sheep.
2. Sheep have scent glands on their face and hooves
One way sheep communicate with each other and their surroundings is through their excellent sense of smell. Sheep have scent glands in front of their eyes and between the digits of their hooves that produce smelly secretions used to communicate with one another!

3. Sheep have rectangular pupils
Rectangular pupils allow for a wide field of vision, around 270 to 320 degrees. This means that sheep can see almost everything around them, except for what’s directly behind them, without turning their heads! As prey species, this helps sheep stay aware of their surroundings and watch for predators, even when their head is down grazing.

4. Sheep are clever animals
Research has shown that sheep can recognize up to 50 other sheep faces and remember them for two years. Sheep can even recognize these faces at different ages and from various angles. Sheep can also recognize human faces, such as their favourite caregivers. Other studies have shown that sheep can remember how to navigate complex mazes.

5. Mothers form strong bonds with their lambs
Adult females, called ewes, form strong emotional bonds with their lambs soon after birth. Ewes stay close to their young lambs and encourage following behaviour, which young lambs learn quickly. Another way sheep communicate with each other is through vocalizations, often called bleating. Ewes can recognize which lambs are theirs by the sound of their calls, and at just 12 hours old, lambs can also identify their mother through sight and by the sound of her call.

A sheep and her lamb grazing on pasture.

6. Sheep can self-medicate
Sheep are selective grazers and prefer eating vegetation near the soil surface. Their upper lip is divided by a distinct groove called a philtrum. The philtrum allows them to get close to the ground and select only the grasses and other vegetation they like – they learn to recognize plants by their taste! They use this ability to eat plants that make them feel better when they are sick or prevent disease, but otherwise hold no nutritional value, and teach their young to do the same.

7. Sheep are emotionally complex
Sheep experience a wide range of emotions, just as humans do. Many studies have highlighted the ability of sheep to feel afraid, angry, bored, sad, and happy. Not only can sheep feel basic emotions, but their feelings can be very complex. For example, scientific studies have shown that sheep can display optimism, pessimism, and empathy! Sheep are sensitive to emotional expressions and can recognize emotion in the facial expressions of their flock mates – an important skill to keep the flock safe.

8. Sheep have ewe-nique personalities
While sheep in a flock may all look the same at first glance, they each have a unique personality! Some of the personality traits that have been identified in sheep are shyness and boldness. Some sheep may be bold and adventurous, while others may be more cautious and shy.

9. Sheep are highly social animals
A group of sheep is called a flock, but sheep do not remain in flocks simply for protection from predators. Sheep form strong bonds with one another. Social bonds are so important to sheep that they prefer to stay with their social group rather than graze at a distance – even for highly desired food! Sheep forced to live in isolation experience distress.

10. Lambs have play dates
Just as our pets may have play dates with others, so do sheep! After about the first week of life, lambs form play groups. Play behaviours in lambs and sheep are well documented, including bucking, spinning, and running around. These behaviours indicate that sheep, like most other animals, express positive emotions when they have the space and freedom to interact with one another.

14 Fun Facts About Fireworks

1. The Chinese used firecrackers to scare off mountain men.

As early as 200 B.C., the Chinese were writing on green bamboo stalks and heating it on coals to dry. Sometimes if left too long over the heat, the wood expanded and even burst, with a bang of course. According to Scientific American, Chinese scholars noticed that the noises effectively scared off abnormally large mountain men. And, thus, the firecracker was born. By some accounts, fireworks were also thought to scare away evil spirits.


2. The invention of fireworks led to the invention of pyrotechnic weaponry—not the other way around.

Sometime between 600 and 900 C.E., Chinese alchemists accidentally mixed saltpeter (or potassium nitrate) with sulfur and charcoal, inadvertently stumbling upon the crude chemical recipe for gunpowder. Supposedly, they had been searching for an elixir for immortality.


This “fire drug” (or huo yao) became an integral part of Chinese cultural celebrations. Stuffing the aforementioned bamboo tubes with gunpowder created a sort of sparkler. It wasn’t long before military engineers used the explosive chemical concoction to their advantage. The first recorded use of gunpowder weaponry in China dates to 1046 and references a crude gunpowder catapult. The Chinese also took traditional bamboo sparklers and attached them to arrows to rain down on their enemies. On a darker note, there are also accounts of fireworks being strapped to rats for use in medieval warfare.

3. Fireworks are just chemical reactions.


A firework requires three key components: an oxidizer, a fuel and a chemical mixture to produce the color. The oxidizer breaks the chemical bonds in the fuel, releasing all of the energy that’s stored in those bonds. To ignite this chemical reaction, all you need is a bit of fire, in the form of a fuse or a direct flame.

In the case of early fireworks, saltpeter was the oxidizing ingredient that drove the reaction, as British scholar Roger Bacon figured out in the early 1200s. Interestingly, Bacon kept his findings a secret, writing them in code to keep them out of the wrong hands.


4. Specific elements produce specific colors.

Firework color concoctions are comprised of different metal elements. When an element burns, its electrons get excited, and it releases energy in the form of light. Different chemicals burn at different wavelengths of light. Strontium and lithium compounds produce deep reds; copper produces blues; titanium and magnesium burn silver or white; calcium creates an orange color; sodium produces yellow pyrotechnics; and finally, barium burns green. Combining chlorine with barium or copper creates neon green and turquoise flames, respectively. Blue is apparently the most difficult to produce. Pyrotechnic stars comprised of these chemicals are typically propelled into the sky using an aerial shell.


5. China may have invented the firework, but Italy invented the aerial shell (and also made fireworks colorful).

Most modern fireworks displays use aerial shells, which resemble ice cream cones. Developed in the 1830s by Italian pyrotechnicians, the shells contain fuel in a cone bottom, while the “scoop” contains an outer layer of pyrotechnic stars, or tiny balls containing the chemicals needed to produce a desired color, and an inner bursting charge. Italians are also credited with figuring out that one could use metallic powders to create specific colors. Today, the shape that the firework produces is a product of the inner anatomy of the aerial shell or rocket.


6. Marco Polo probably wasn’t the first to bring gunpowder to Europe.

While Marco Polo did return from China in 1295 with fireworks, some argue that Europeans were likely exposed to gunpowder weaponry a little earlier during the Crusades. In the 9th century, China began trying to control the flow of gunpowder to its neighbors, in hopes of keeping the benefits of the technology to itself in case of conflict. Given that Arabs used various types of gunpowder-like weapons during the Crusades, gunpowder likely spread to the Middle East along the Silk Road in the intervening period, despite China’s best efforts.


7. Boom! Hiss! Crack! Some firework recipes include sound elements.

Layers of an organic salt, like sodium salicylate, combined with the oxidizer potassium perchlorate burn one at a time. As each layer burns, it slowly releases a gas, creating the whistling sound associated with most firework rockets. Aluminum or iron flakes can create hissing or sizzling sparkles, while titanium powder can create loud blasts, in addition to white sparks.


8. Fireworks are poisonous.

Given their ingredients, it makes sense that fireworks are not so great for the environment. Exploding a firework releases heavy metals, dioxins, perchlorates and other air pollutants into the atmosphere, and these pollutants have serious health effects in high doses. Barium nitrate can cause lung problems, while the oxidizer potassium perchlorate has been linked to thyroid problems and birth defects.


9. You can’t recycle fireworks.

Again, given their components, it’s probably not too surprising that recycling exploded fireworks isn’t an option. Before tossing them in the trash, soaking the discards in water is always a good idea. Any cardboard is likely too dirty to be of any value to recyclers, though it’s always a good idea to check with your city or municipality’s waste department. If you are trying to dispose of unused fireworks, it’s a good idea to call them as well, as most have special disposal procedures for explosives.

10. Don’t worry, chemists are developing more environmentally friendly firework recipes.

Some groups have already found substitutes for barium compounds and potassium perchlorate. By replacing chlorine with iodine, a team at the U.S. Army’s Pyrotechnics Technology and Prototyping Division found that sodium and potassium periodate are both safe and effective oxidizers. The same group also found success replacing barium with boron. The work is aimed at making more environmentally friendly flares for military use, but could also be applied to civilian fireworks. Some fireworks that use nitrogen-rich compounds in place of perchlorates have been used in small displays, but the challenge is making eco-friendly products as cheap as alternatives.


11. Americans have been setting off fireworks to celebrate their independence since 1777, at least.

Even some of the very first Independence Day celebrations involved fireworks. On July 4, 1777, Philadelphia put together an elaborate day of festivities, notes American University historian James R. Heintze. The celebration included a 13 cannon display, a parade, a fancy dinner, toasts, music, musket salutes, “loud huzzas,” and of course fireworks. Heintze cites this description from the Virginia Gazette on July 18, 1777:


“The evening was closed with the ringing of bells, and at night there was a grand exhibition of fireworks, which began and concluded with thirteen rockets on the commons, and the city was beautifully illuminated. Every thing was conducted with the greatest order and decorum, and the face of joy and gladness was universal. Thus may the 4th of July, that glorious and ever memorable day, be celebrated through America, by the sons of freedom, from age to age till time shall be no more.”

12. Fireworks aren’t for everybody.

Dogs whimper. Cats hide under the bed. Birds become so startled they get disoriented and fly into things. Even some people have extreme fears of fireworks or noise phobia.

13. Fireworks are dangerous (duh).

It might seem obvious, but it’s worth noting for those who plan to tinker with pyrotechnics in the backyard this 4th of July. Last year saw an uptick in fireworks-related injuries according to a new report by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In 2012, 8,700 people injured themselves using fireworks, and in 2013, that tally jumped to 11,300 people. Roughly 65 percent of those injuries happened in the 30 days surrounding July 4th. More than 40 percent of the injuries involved sparklers and rockets. In addition to injuries, fireworks can also spark wildfires.

14. Fireworks have been used in pranks for centuries.

After a series of fireworks shenanigans in 1731, officials in Rhode Island outlawed the use of fireworks for mischievous ends. At the turn of the 20th century, the Society for the Suppression of Unnecessary Noise campaigned against the use of fireworks (and other elements of urban hubbub), and their efforts are largely responsible for the first fireworks regulations in the United States. 




10 Fun Facts About Japan

1. It’s good manners to slurp your noodles
Japan values good manners highly, but when it comes to chowing down on bowlfuls of noodles, there’s only one way to eat: noisily. Slurping is a sign of enjoyment and also cools down the noodles as you eat. Get your chopsticks in one hand and lean over your bowl. Bibs are sometimes provided for foreigners, but by the time you leave, you should be able to polish off a bowl in a white top and walk out spotless.


2. The traditional Christmas Eve meal is KFC
Plenty of Japanese people celebrate Christmas, but the festive fare isn’t what you might expect. In Japan, it’s traditional to head to your local KFC on Christmas Eve. An estimated 3.6 million Japanese feast on the KFC Christmas Dinner and hours of queuing and ordering weeks in advance is expected. Some say turkey and chicken wasn’t widely available for the Christmas-curious Japanese, so Colonel Sanders stepped in to answer the demand…

3. Japan is not all about the cities
Japan’s big-name stars are its densely populated cities, and it’s not a country you’d think of as a scarcely populated, mountain wilderness. However, around 70% of Japan is made up of forest and mountains that aren’t suitable for farming or living in. There are over 100 active volcanoes, and its tallest mountain is the famed Mount Fuji, with its elevation of 3,776 meters.


4. There’s a Rabbit Island in Japan
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands. The little island of Okunoshima in the Inland Sea is best-known for its curious, big-eared population. The island was used to test chemical weapons during World War II, and it’s said the test subjects roamed free after the war. Either way, the numbers flourished in a predator-free environment (dogs and cats are banned from entering), and today Okunoshima is a popular spot for cuddle-bunny tourists.

5. The number four is extremely unlucky
The number four (‘shi’) is widely avoided in Japan since it sounds too similar to the Japanese word for death. Keep an eye out in Japan and you’ll notice buildings don’t have a fourth floor, items are sold in sets of three or five and special care is taken to avoid encountering the number in daily life.


6. There’s a bizarre naked festival
Japan is well-known for its non-stop festivals, but Hadaka Matsuri must be one of the most bizarre. Thousands of Japanese men strip naked in public to secure a fortune-filled year, with the biggest matsuri taking place in Okayama, where an estimated 9,000 men get down to their fundoshi.

7. Japanese trains are some of the most punctual in the world
The average delay of Japanese trains is 18 seconds. What makes them so punctual? Drivers are trained in ultra-realistic simulators and drive one train line only – many don’t even need a speedometer to know how fast they’re going. Competition is also fierce between rail companies, so lagging behind won’t do – they work hard to keep hold of Japan’s huge numbers of train commuters, whatever it takes (even if it means building fancy department stores in the stations…).


8. The Japanese love wacky flavours
Eel flavoured ice cream and Green Tea Kit Kats are just two of the weird and wonderful flavours you can come across in Japan. Kit Kats are the most popular confectionary (‘Kit Kat’ sounds similar to ‘kitto katsu’, a Japanese saying meaning ‘good luck.’) You can try edamame, wasabi and ginger ale flavoured Kit Kats, too.

9. Everyone has their own seal
In Japan, people don’t have signatures – they have their own seal. Known as Hanko, the seal is typically your name translated into Kanji characters, and are made from silk or plant-based paste. Adults will often have three Hankos; one for signing off letters and personal matters, a bank seal and an identity seal. They’re not necessary for tourists, but foreigners living in Japan can have one handmade in small, local shops.


10. Anti-Ninja floors are a thing
During the feudal period, wealthy Japanese lords built homes with deliberately squeaky floors (known as Nightingale Floors) as a defence measure against Ninjas. The highly trained, legendary mercenaries of feudal Japan were so steeped in myth and folklore, they were said to be capable of walking on water, turning invisible and controlling natural elements. That’s got to be motivation to put down some new flooring.
